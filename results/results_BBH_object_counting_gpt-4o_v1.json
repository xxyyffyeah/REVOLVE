Use bullet points or numbered lists to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Summarize Reasoning**: Provide a concise summary of the reasoning process, focusing on the key steps only.\n\n4. **Verification**: Perform a self-check of your calculations. Restate the final sum and confirm its accuracy against the expected answer.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Clarifications**: If any assumptions are made, clearly state and justify them.

Follow these steps to ensure clarity, consistency, and accuracy:\n\n1. **Clarify Task Requirements**:\n   - Your primary task is to accurately count and list all items mentioned in the question, ensuring the final numerical count matches the expected answer.\n   - Explicitly define what constitutes an \"object\" in the context of the task, distinguishing between categories such as animals, fruits, and other objects.\n\n2. **Identify and Count**:\n   - **List All Items**: Identify each item mentioned in the question and list them explicitly with their corresponding count using a structured, numbered format.\n   - **Categorize Items**: Provide a brief description of their category or type, ensuring clarity in distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant items.\n   - Ensure the list is complete and visible, checking for any missing parts or duplicates.\n\n3. **Summarize Counting Logic**:\n   - Clearly state the counting logic, e.g., \"Each item is counted as one object.\"\n   - Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the counting process, including any intermediate calculations, to justify the final total.\n   - Ensure that the counting logic directly supports the final answer and provide a narrative or rationale for the logic used.\n\n4. **Verification and Cross-Checking**:\n   - Perform a self-check of your calculations.\n   - Restate the final sum and provide a brief summary of the counting process to ensure it matches the expected answer.\n   - Implement a cross-checking mechanism where you re-evaluate the listed items and calculations using an alternative method to ensure they match the expected answer.\n   - Conduct a final review of the entire process to ensure consistency and accuracy of the final answer.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Clarifications**:\n   - Clearly state any assumptions made, providing examples if necessary.\n   - If the query is unclear, ask a clarifying question before proceeding.\n   - If no assumptions are made, state 'None.' If assumptions are implicit, such as assuming all items are functional, explicitly state them.\n   - Identify potential sources of ambiguity and provide a brief explanation or example of how it is resolved.\n\n6. **Error Handling and Iterative Refinement**:\n   - If there is any uncertainty or potential discrepancy in the count, provide a range or ask for clarification to ensure accuracy.\n   - After completing the steps, review the entire response for coherence and accuracy.\n   - Make adjustments as necessary to ensure the final answer is both correct and clearly communicated.\n   - Apply this structured approach to a variety of similar tasks, ensuring the methodology is robust and adaptable to different contexts.\n\n7. **Final Answer Format**:\n   - The last line of your response should be: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value.\n   - Double-check your numerical calculations to ensure the final count is correct.\n   - Consider using a confidence score to indicate the likelihood of your answer being accurate and justify this score by referencing specific factors.\n   - Include a confidence score with the final answer to indicate the likelihood of accuracy.\n\n8. **User Feedback Mechanism**:\n   - Explicitly encourage user feedback on your responses. Ask users to confirm the count or provide additional context.\n   - Reflect on user feedback and adjust your strategies accordingly, fostering continuous improvement and adaptation.\n\nBy following these steps, ensure that your response is clear, concise, and accurate.
