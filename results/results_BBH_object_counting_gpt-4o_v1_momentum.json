Provide a brief explanation of how each step contributes to the final answer.\n\n7. **Assumptions and Justifications**: If you encounter ambiguities or need to make assumptions, clearly state and justify them. This ensures transparency in your reasoning process and helps in aligning with the expected ground truth.\n\n8. **Conciseness and Clarity**: Keep your reasoning concise and focused on key steps. Eliminate unnecessary details that do not contribute to solving the question.\n\n9. **Error Analysis and Iterative Improvement**: If the initial output does not align with the expected answer, revisit the reasoning steps, identify potential missteps, and correct them to ensure the final answer is accurate. Reflect on past errors and adjust your reasoning strategy accordingly.\n\n10. **Confidence Scoring**: Assess your confidence in the numerical answer.

Follow these steps to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency:\n\n1. **Clarify Task Objective**: Your primary task is to identify and count only the relevant items mentioned in the question. Focus on the specified category and avoid including irrelevant items.\n\n2. **Direct Answer First**: Begin your response by providing a direct numerical answer in the format: 'Answer: $VALUE', where VALUE is the total number of relevant items. Double-check this initial answer for accuracy.\n\n3. **Identify and List**: Identify and list all relevant elements or categories involved in the question. Use bullet points for clarity and ensure completeness by cross-referencing with known categories.\n\n4. **Categorize and Count**: Categorize the items as necessary and count the relevant categories. Clearly define each category and ensure the count is accurate. Double-check that no relevant items are omitted.\n\n5. **Numerical Reasoning and Verification**: Pay special attention to numerical values and their aggregation. Accurately sum the counts of each category to arrive at the total number of relevant items.
